          <h3 style="background: lightgray; color: white;">Piezo Volume Adjustment</h3>
          <p>The PRS piezo bridge has six adjustable trim pots which allow the volume of each string to be raised or lowered.<br>
             The trim pots are small, white, phillips head screws which are accessible through the battery compartment.<br>
             The volume of each string has been set at the factory, but they can be adjusted to meet your personal tastesM<br>
             by using a small phillips head screw driver.

          <h3 style="background: lightgray; color: white;">Changing String Gauges</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>If you decide to change your string gauges from the factory installed string gauges, 
                  please be sure to remember that the guitar may need to be set-up to accommodate this change.
                  This may include checking the action, intonation, neck relief, pickup height, and nut slots of the instrument.
                  We set-up the guitars at our factory with the following string gauges:
              </li>
              <li>Most USA manufactured electric PRS instruments* are factory set-up with PRS Signature 10 - 46 gauge strings.
              </li><li>*The USA manufactured PRS piezo equipped Hollowbody models are factory set up with PRS Signature 11 - 49 
                  gauge strings with a plain 3rd.
              </li>
              <li>*The PRS DGT is factory set up with PRS Signature David Grissom  11 - 49 gauge strings with plain 3rd.</li>
              <li>Most PRS SE* solidbody instruments are factory set-up with PRS Classic 9 - 42 gauge strings.</li> 
              <li>The PRS SE 277 is factory set-up with 14-68 gauge strings.</li>
              <li>*The PRS SE Mark Holcomb SVN is factory set up with 10-64 gauge strings.</li>
              <li>*The PRS SE Paul's Guitar is factory set-up with PRS Classic 10-46 gauge strings.</li>
              <li>*All PRS SE Hollowbody instruments are factory set-up with PRS Classic 10-46 gauge strings.</li>

          <ul>
            <li>First, once the strings are thoroughly stretched, tune the instrument to pitch.
                Repeat stretching and tuning the instrument.
            </li>
            <li>Then, adjust the truss rod relief, and re-tune the instrument.</li>
            <p>Using a capo at the first fret, measure the distance from top of fret
               to bottom of string while depressing the string at the 1st and last fret:
               Relief for PRS SE guitars should measure .3/64" - .6/64" (.1mm - .3mm) at the 8th fret.<br>
               Once the relief has been set, re-tune the instrument. 
               The measurements for string height should be as follows 
               (measure from the top center of the fret, to the bottom of the string):
            </p>
          </ul>
            <p>6 String</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Treble side string height 1st fret: .64/64” - 1.5/64" (.2mm - .6mm)</li>
                <li>Bass side string height 1st fret: 1/64” - 2/64" (.4mm - .8mm)</li>
                <li>Treble-side string height at 12th fret: 1.8/32" - 2.3/32"  (1.4mm -1.8mm)</li>
                <li>Bass-side string height at 12th fret: 2.2/32” - 2.4/32" (1.5mm - 2mm)</li>
                <li>Floyd Rose Treble side string height 1st fret: .6/64” - 1.5/64" (.2mm - .6mm)</li>
                <li>Floyd Rose Bass side string height 1st fret: 1/64” - 2/64" (.4mm - .8mm)</li>
                <li>Floyd Rose Treble-side string height at 12th fret: 1.8/32" - 2.3/32"  (1.4mm -1.8mm)</li>
                <li>Floyd Rose Bass-side string height at 12th fret: 2.2/32” - 2.4/32" (1.5mm - 2mm)</li>
                <li>String height should escalate in value from Hi E to low E </li>

          <h3 style="background: lightgray; color: white;">Pickup Adjustments</h3>
          <p>The pickups on your new PRS instrument are fully adjustable by turning 
             the height adjustment screws at each end of the pickup.<br>
             Once the action, intonation and neck relief are set to spec and the 
             instrument is tuned to pitch, with the high and low E strings<br> depressed
             at the last fret, measurement is taken from the bottom of the string,<br> 
             to the top center of the pickup bobbin or cover.
          </p>

          <h3 style="background: lightgray; color: white;">Installing a Nut/Cutting Nut Slots</h3>
          <p>Although PRS offers pre-slotted string nuts for sale, each nut will need to be 
             fine tuned to achieve a proper set up. Sand the bottom side of the nut flat, and 
             then glue the nut into place using superglue.<br> Then, using the correct set of nut 
             slot files, fine tune each slot so that the strings does not bind in the slot. 
             This particular aspect of a set-up can be extremely tricky. <br>If you are unfamiliar 
             with this type of adjustment, it is best to seek the services of a trained guitar 
             technician.
