    <h3 class="history">History</h3>
    <ul>
      <p class="ulPTags">1960~1971</p>
      <li class="list1">At the early age of 6, Chan's parents left him in Hong Kong and moved to Australia.</li>
      <li class="list2">While in Hong Kong he attended China Drama Academy. This is where he spent almost a decade honing his martial art and acrobatic skills.
        <br>He became one of the schools best alumni.  He practiced hapkido under the grand master Jin Pal Kim the grand master where he would eventually earn his black belt.
      </li>
      <li class="list3">He began his film career by appearing in small roles at the age of five as a child actor. At age eight, he appeared with some of his fellow <br>
        "Little Fortunes" in the film Big and Little Wong Tin Bar (1962) with Li Li-Hua playing his mother. The following year, the young actor appeared in extras <br>
        of Yen Chun's 1964 film Liang Shan Po and Chu Ying Tai and had a small role in King Hu's 1966 film Come Drink with Me. In 1971, after an appearance as an<br>
        extra in another kung fu film, A Touch of Zen, Chan was signed to Chu Mu's Great Earth Film Company.
      </li>
      <li class="list4">Chan joined his parents in Canberra, Australia in 1971, where he briefly attended Dickson College and worked as a construction worker.<br>
         A fellow builder named Jack took Chan under his wing, thus earning Chan the nickname of "Little Jack," later shortened to "Jackie", 
         which has stuck with him ever since.
      </li>
      <p class="ulPTags">1976~1980</p>
      <li class="list5">In 1976, Jackie Chan received a telegram from Willie Chan, a film producer in the Hong Kong film industry who had been impressed <br>
        with Jackie's stunt choreography work. Willie Chan offered him an acting role in a film directed by Lo Wei.Lo saw Chan's performance <br>in the
        John Woo film Hand of Death (1976) and planned to model him after Bruce Lee with the film New Fist of Fury. 
      </li>
      <li class="list6">Willie Chan became Jackie's personal manager and firm friend, and remained so for over 30 years. He was instrumental in <br>
        launching Chan's international career, beginning with his first forays into the American film industry in the 1980s. His first Hollywood<br>
        film was The Big Brawl in 1980. Chan then played a minor role in the 1981 film The Cannonball Run, which grossed over US$100 million worldwide</li>
      <p class="ulPTags">1980~1990</p>
      <li class="list7">Chan has performed most of his own stunts throughout his film career, which are choreographed by the Jackie Chan Stunt Team.<br>
        The team was established in 1983, and Chan has used them in all his subsequent films to make choreographing easier, given his understanding of each member's abilities. </li>
      <li class="list8">After the commercial failure of The Protector in 1985, Chan temporarily abandoned his attempts to break into the US market, returning his focus to Hong Kong films.</li>
      <li class="list9">Chan founded the Jackie Chan Charitable Foundation in 1988 to offer scholarship and active help to Hong Kong's young people and provide aid to victims of natural disaster <br>
        or illness. In 2005, Chan created the Dragon's Heart Foundation to help children and the elderly in remote areas of China by building schools, providing books, fees, and uniforms for children;<br>
        the organisation expanded its reach to Europe in 2011.
      </li>
      <li class="list10">After the 1997 handover of Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China, Chan's politics gradually shifted from a pro-democratic to a pro-Beijing stance. <br>
        In 1989, Chan performed at the Concert for Democracy in China in support of democratic movement during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests; by 2021, in contrast, he expressed<br>
        his desire to join the Chinese Communist Party.
      </li>
      <li class="list11">A number of video games have been based on, or featured, Jackie Chan. His film Wheels on Meals (called Spartan X in Japan) spawned the hit 1984 beat <br>
        'em up arcade game Spartan X (released as Kung-Fu Master in Western markets), and its sequel Spartan X 2 for the Nintendo Famicom console. Spartan X laid the foundations<br>
        for the beat 'em up genre, and inspired other games including Super Mario Bros. (1985) and Street Fighter (1987). Jackie Chan's Action Kung Fu was released in 1990 for the PC-Engine <br>
        and Nintendo Entertainment System. 
      </li>
      <p class="ulPTags">1994~2000</p>
      <li class="list12">In 1995, Chan was featured in the arcade game Jackie Chan The Kung-Fu Master. A series of Japanese video games were released on the MSX computer by Pony, <br>
        based on several of Chan's films (Project A, Project A 2, Police Story, The Protector and Wheels on Meals). Other games based on Jackie Chan include Jackie Chan Stuntmaster, <br>
        Jackie Chan Adventures and Jackie Chan J-Mat Fitness. Chan also inspired video game characters such as Lei Wulong in Tekken and the fighting-type Pok√©mon Hitmonchan.
      </li>
      <li class="list14">Chan finally succeeded in establishing a foothold in the North American market in 1995 with a worldwide release of Rumble in the Bronx, <br>
        attaining a cult following in the United States that was rare for Hong Kong movie stars. The success of Rumble in the Bronx led to a 1996 release of Police <br>
        Story 3: Super Cop in the United States under the title Supercop, which grossed a total of US$16,270,600. Chan's first huge blockbuster success came when <br>
        he co-starred with Chris Tucker in the 1998 buddy cop action comedy Rush Hour, grossing US$130 million in the United States alone. This film made him a Hollywood star,<br>
        after which he wrote his autobiography in collaboration with Jeff Yang entitled I Am Jackie Chan.
      </li>
      <li class="list15">Chan received his honorary Doctorate of Social Science degree in 1996 from the Hong Kong Baptist University. <br>
        In 2009, he received another honorary doctorate from the University of Cambodia, and has also been awarded an honorary professorship <br>
        by the Savannah College of Art and Design in Hong Kong in 2008.
      </li>
      <p class="ulPTags">2000~to be continued:</p>
      <li class="list16">His 100th movie, 1911, was released on 26 September 2011. Chan was the co-director, executive producer, <br>
        and lead star of the movie. While Chan has directed over ten films over his career, this was his first directorial work since Who Am I? in 1998. 1911 premiered in North America on 14 October.
      </li>
      <li class="list17">Despite the success of the Rush Hour and Shanghai Noon films, Chan became frustrated with Hollywood over the limited range of roles and lack of control over the filmmaking process. <br>
        In response to Golden Harvest's withdrawal from the film industry in 2003, Chan started his own film production company, JCE Movies Limited (Jackie Chan Emperor Movies Limited) in association with <br>
        Emperor Multimedia Group (EMG). His films have since featured an increasing number of dramatic scenes while continuing to succeed at the box office; examples include New Police Story (2004), The Myth (2005) and the hit film Rob-B-Hood (2006).</li>
      <li class="list18">Chan is one of the most recognisable and influential film personalities in the world, with a widespread global following in both the Eastern and Western hemispheres. He has received fame stars on the Hong Kong Avenue of Stars<br>
        and the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Chan has been referenced in various pop songs, cartoons, films, and video games. He is an operatically trained vocalist and is also a Cantopop and Mandopop star.
